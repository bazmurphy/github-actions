## Understanding Job Artifacts

- Job Artifacts

- When we run a Job, Examples:

  - Building a Website produces a build/dist folder
  - Building a Mobile App produces a Package to upload to an App Store
  - Building an Desktop App produces an Binary Executable

- We generate some assets that we upload somewhere
- These assets are generally called Job Artifacts
- A Job Artifact is the Output/Assets generated by a Job

- With GitHub Actions we can save those Artifacts

  - We can download them manually
  - We can download them automatically and use them in other Jobs

- It doesn't have to be just binaries, it can also be log files etc.
- But they are files/folders produced by a Job that we want to use in other Jobs or manually inspect

## Artifacts - An Example

- When we run `npm run build` for example it produces a `/dist` folder

- It would be useful if we could store and use those produced folders/files

- Well we can store them and access with GitHub Actions

- This `/dist` folder is the Artifact produced by the `build` Job

## Uploading Job Artifacts

- To store the Artifact we add a new Step

- We use an Action `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
  https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact

- `name` is required, we use it to retrieve the artifact later
- `path` is required, to tell it which files/folders to store

```yml
steps:
  # This allows us to Upload Artifacts
  - name: Upload Artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
    with:
      # we give the Artifact a name, so we can retrieve it later
      name: dist-artifact
      # this defines which files you want to store
      path: dist
```

- Now when we run this Workflow, if we visit the Workflow that was run on GitHub, the artifacts are available at to manually download

## Downloading Artifacts (Manually & Automatically)

- Each Job is run on its own Runner, the Artifact produced in the `build` Job will not automatically exist in the `deploy` Job.
- So if we want to use the Artifact created in the `build` Job in the `deploy` Job, we need a way of getting a hold of the Artifact.
- In order to get those Artifacts we need to download them using an Action
- Download Artifact Action https://github.com/actions/download-artifact

- We must provide a `with` and a `name` that references the Artifact identifier (in this case from the `build` Job above)

- NOTE: It unzips the Artifact, but WITHOUT the original folder, so the files will not be inside a `dist` folder but in the root of the default directory

```yml
steps:
  - name: Download Artifacts
    uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
    with:
      # we need to provide the Artifact identifier
      name: dist-artifact
```
