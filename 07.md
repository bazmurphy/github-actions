- Workflows typically run from start to finish and stop execution if an error occurs
- Job execution is canceled if any Step within the Job fails
- Default behaviour is for all subsequent Steps and Jobs not to be executed if one Job fails
- In some cases, you may want to continue executing Steps even if one Step fails
- You might also need Steps to be executed only if another Step fails
- It's important to have control over when specific Jobs and Steps execute
- Execution flow control allows you to run Jobs and Steps conditionally
- GitHub Actions provides tools to control Job and Step execution
- Concepts like execution matrices and Job matrices will be explored
- Reusable Workflows can reduce the need for extra code and save time

## Understanding Conditional Steps & Jobs

- Conditional Job and Step execution is introduced using two main tools:
  - the `if` field, which can be added to Jobs and Steps to specify conditions for execution
  - the `continue-on-error` field, which allows certain Steps to proceed even if others fail
- Expressions can be used to customize conditions for both the `if` and `continue-on-error` fields
