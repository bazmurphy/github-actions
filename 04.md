## A Demo Project Setup

-

## More on the "push" Event

- We can be more specific with Events
- For example instead of a `push` triggering all Workflows, a `push` to a specific branch can trigger a specific Workflow

## Introducing Event Filters & Activity Types

- Some Events have Activity Types

  - specify in greater detail which exact version or variation of the Event should trigger a Workflow
  - `pull_request` Event has for example `opened`, `closed`, `edited`, etc

- Some Events have Filters
  - more control over when a Workflow will be triggered
  - `push` Event can be filtered based on target branch (`main` for example)

## Using Activity Types

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows

- On `pull_request` Event we can see the Activity Types

- If we don't select any Activity Types all (or predefined) types will Trigger the Workflow
- For `pull_request` Event the documentation states that `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened` will Trigger the Workflow (if no Activity Types are defined)
- We can also define specific Activity Types eg. `closed`

```yml
on:
  # specific Event
  pull_request:
    # specific Activity Types
    types:
      # Activity Type Name
      - opened
  # another Event
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## Using Event Filters

## Special Behaviour: Forks & Pull Request Events

## Cancelling Workflows & Skipping Workflows
