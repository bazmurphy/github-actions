## Project Setup & Understanding Environment Variables

- In your code you need to have certain dynamic Values
- For example in Node `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
- Like a password that is used for logging into a Database
- But there might be different databases for different Environments `testing` and `production`
- So different password values might be needed
- We have to provide those values to our Workflow, and they may need to change depending on the Job

```js
// DATABASE
const clusterAddress = process.env.MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS;
const dbUser = process.env.MONGODB_USERNAME;
const dbPassword = process.env.MONGODB_PASSWORD;
const dbName = process.env.MONGODB_DB_NAME;

// PORT
app.listen(process.env.PORT);
```

## Providing Environment Variable Values

- You can provide `environment` variables at different places
- You can provide the values at the Workflow level, Job level, and Step level

```yml
name: Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
# Set the environment variables at the Workflow level
env:
  MONGO_DB_NAME: some-database-name
```

```yml
name: Deployment
jobs:
  test:
    # Set the environment variables at the Job level
    env:
      MONGO_CLUSTER_ADDRESS: some-test-database-address
      MONGO_USERNAME: some-test-database-username
      MONGO_PASSWORD: some-test-database-password
```
