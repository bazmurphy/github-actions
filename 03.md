## Key Elements

- Workflows

- Jobs

- Steps

## Relation

- You have a GitHub Repository

- Workflows are attached to those Repositories
- You can add as many Workflows as you want
- The Workflow is the first thing you build

- A Workflow includes one or more Jobs

- Jobs contain one or more Steps
- The Steps will be executed in the order they are specified
- And the Steps define the actual things that will be done

- 1st Step: Download the Code
- 2nd Step: Install the Depedencies
- 3rd Step: Run Automated Tests

- That's what you can do with a Github Actions Workflow, with a Job and the appropriate Steps.

- You can have as many Workflows as you want
- You can have as many Jobs in a Workflow as you want
- You can have as many Steps in a Job as you want

### Workflows

- Workflows are Attached to a GitHub Repository
- Contain one or more Jobs
- You should build those Workflows with those Jobs to set up some Automated Process that should Executed.
- You assign triggers called Events to your Workflows
- These Events define when a given Workflow will be Executed
- For example, whenever a new commit is pushed to a certain Branch

### Jobs

- The Jobs are the things inside the Events that contain the Steps that will be Executed.
- Every Job defines Runner which is the execution environment, the machine and operating system that will be used for Executing those Steps

- These Runners can be ones predefined by GitHub - they offer Linux, MacOS, Windows
- You can also configure your own Runners
- Jobs contain one or more Steps
- Jobs run in Parallel by Default or can run in Sequential order
- Jobs can also be Conditional

### Steps

- A Step is either:
- A shell script, a command in the command line that should be Executed
- Or an Action, which are a predefined script that perform certain tasks.
- You can build your own Actions if you need to
- A Job must have one or more Steps, and they are Executed in Order (not in Parallel)
- A Step can also be Conditional
